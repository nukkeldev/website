# Motivation

- Hello, World => Clear ; Very cursory introduction, not a display of semantics
- ??? => Triangle ; this is our patient we'll be autopsying
- Novice at GAPIs in general, 2 years of experience with primarily `wgpu`
- Preface for designing an RHI, more on that in a different post.
    - SDL3GPU -> NRI -> Homebrewed

# Setup

- Analyzing official examples in the source language of the API (C for Vulkan, C++ for Dawn, etc.)
- Covering examples for `Vulkan`, `WebGPU` (`Dawn`, maybe `wgpu`), D3D12 (maybe 11 too), and OpenGL.
    - Not Metal as I don't use MacOS.
- All built with Zig's build system (clang).
- Host and device side tracing with Tracy for available APIs (all except WebGPU) as well as NVidia NSight.
    - Look at draw calls, render passes, frame preparation times, etc.
- Analyze APIs in reverse chronological order, might be better to show what we hadn't though we were missing.
- All code is in GH repo.

## Shaders

- All examples use the same _modern_ Slang shader, compiled to the proper formats.
