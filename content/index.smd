This is my personal site that holds [writings](/writing) of varying topics, random things I've
learnt or found, and updates on what I'm working on. You can find the source of
this website [here](https://github.com/nukkeldev/website). If you would like to contact
me, please use my email: [nukkel.dev@gmail.com](mailto:nukkel.dev@gmail.com) or Discord (`nukkeldev`).

>## [styleguide]($block)
> While I am by no means a designer (_very, very far from it_), I take care to 
> make sure that this website is as put together as I am able to. 
> The primary font for both the content and the code of this website is [0xProto](https://github.com/0xType/0xProto) 
> with headings using [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).
> The color palette is sampled from **Catppuccin Mocha** (the best theme by far.)

## TODO

- Add a footer to show when the page was generated and the commit hash.
