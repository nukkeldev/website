Alongside the development of [`zpp`](https://github.com/nukkeldev/zpp), I've recently
started pursing the [CCNA certification](https://www.cisco.com/site/us/en/learn/training-certifications/certifications/enterprise/ccna/index.html). 
From the brief time I've spent on the field, I really enjoy learning about it as well as experimenting
with the things I've learnt. Additionally, I would be interested in network administration as a career.

Currently, I am working through Cisco Packet Tracer courses on [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/)
and you can find my notes and progress [here](https://github.com/nukkeldev/cisco-packet-tracer).

I ~seem to~ start and stop projects quite frequently and unfortunately, [`garden`](https://github.com/nukkeldev/garden)
has suffered the same fate. I'd been working on garden for the better part of two months and had gotten it
to a place where none of the features I could further implement in-line with its current course had 
much interest to me. While I do enjoy graphics programming, the next step that I felt inclined to pursue
for the engine was swapping the RHI from SDL3 GPU to NRI which is significantly more complicated.

I have a branch on there for a demo of using NRI + GLFW in Zig that works, but integrating it into the engine
isn't something I have the motivation to do right now.

I enjoy projects with quick iteration times and visible results, to which a graphics engine is neither.
I will likely come back to `garden` in the future when I am more comfortable with graphics programming. For now though,
I am working on [`zpp`](https://github.com/nukkeldev/zpp), a Zig binding generator for C++ headers, in order to 
have automated binding creation for ImGui and other related libraries.

Stemming off `zpp`, my next (genius) idea is a more cohesive IDE for Zig. I intend to use the application framework I am developing `zpp` for: 
[`bloom`](https://github.com/nukkeldev/bloom). I don't have the idea fully fleshed out but it's going to be a fun experiment 
to see if I can make a better _personal_ development environment.
